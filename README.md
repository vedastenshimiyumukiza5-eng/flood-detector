# FloodSense — Static Website

This is a responsive static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for a flood detection & early-warning company. It implements the structure and UI concepts you requested:

- Home (index.html) — hero, trust bar, solution cards, how-it-works timeline, meet the team
- Solution page (solution.html)
- USSD page (ussd.html) — demo of USSD/SMS feature
- Impact page (impact.html)
- About page (about.html)
- Contact page (contact.html)

Team (as requested):
- Vedaste NSHIMIYUMUKIZA — Project Manager
- Joyeux Pierre ISHIMWE — IT & Technician

How to use:
1. Put all files in the same folder. Create an `images/` folder for photos (or edit image paths).
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to preview.
3. Replace placeholder images (images/*.jpg) with your real photos or illustrations.

Deployment suggestions:
- Host as a static site: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or a simple static web host.
- For contact form processing, connect the form to a backend or use a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms).

Design notes & next steps:
- Replace the placeholder illustrations with high-quality photos or vector illustrations (sensor, map, community).
- Consider adding analytics, accessibility audits, and translations if you’ll target multiple regions.
- If you want, I can:
  - convert this into a single-page app with smooth scroll,
  - add a backend endpoint for the contact form,
  - prepare high-fidelity Figma frames (I can describe exact frames or provide an export-ready spec).
